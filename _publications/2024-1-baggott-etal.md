We collected in vitro potencies (IC50s) for 24 stimulant-like drugs to inhibit [3H]neurotransmitter uptake at all three human monoamine transporters (MAT): those for dopamine (DAT), norepinephrine (NET), and 5-HT (SERT). Exploratory pairwise correlations were followed by cross-validated penalized multivariate regression (LASSO) to predict dose. Models were fit both with and without commonly used drug physiochemical descriptors: LogP, LogD (at 7.4 pH); aqueous solubility (LogS); basic pKa; topological polar surface area (tPSA); nitrogen & oxygen count (NOC)). We assessed model performance with subsampling (training sets of 22 drugs, evaluation sets of 2 drugs), repeating the process for all 276 possible splits.
IC50s from human & rat transporters are well correlated. Human oral dose is positively correlated with IC50s at hDAT, rDAT, and rNET, and negatively correlated with LogP. NET was the most useful MAT for predicting dose. LogP was the most consistently useful descriptor. Models using either rMAT or hMAT can predict human oral dose reasonably well.
