We use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify cortical and subcortical components of the visual system. In particular, we localized many topographically-organized visual cortical areas as well as the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and the magnocellular and parvocellular subdivisions thereof. We report the extension of this M/P localization procedure to fMRI data acquired with multiband
acceleration. We also examined thalamocortical coupling between the LGN subdivisions and visual cortical areas but found no effects of stimulus type or spatial attention.
