I am a data scientist and Ph.D. neuroscientist focused on using data-driven approaches and modern computational tools to accelerate innovation across sectors.

Over the past decade, I have applied machine learning techniques to neuroscience research in Python (Pandas, SciPy, scikit-learn, etc.) and R. Most recently, I spearheaded data science initiatives at a pharmatech startup focused on developing next-generation mental wellness medications. I have recent experience with modern informational infrastructure such as Docker, Spark, orchestration frameworks, and cloud (AWS) services as well as two decades of experience with Python, Linux, and relational databases like PostgreSQL/MySQL. In addition, I possess a graduate-level knowledge of statistics, psychology, and research methods.
