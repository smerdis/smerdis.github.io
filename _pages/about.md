I am a data scientist and Ph.D. neuroscientist with two decades of tech experience. Iâ€™m particularly interested in using data-driven approaches and modern computational tools to accelerate healthcare innovation.

For the past decade, I have been applying machine learning techniques to neuroscience research in Python (Pandas, SciPy, scikit-learn, etc.) and R. I have recent experience with modern informational infrastructure such as Spark, Docker, orchestration frameworks, and cloud (AWS) services as well as two decades of experience with Python, Linux, and relational databases like PostgreSQL/MySQL. In addition, I possess a graduate-level knowledge of neuroscience, statistics, and research methods.
